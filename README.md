### Hi, I'm Amarise ðŸ˜„

I'm a Data scientist/Bioinformatician with a MSc Bioinformatics & Systems Biology and a Bachelor's in Computer Science (Bioinformatics track).

- :dna: During my internship at LUMC, I focused on developing a pipeline in Nextflow to analyze a variant of RNA-seq data.

- :technologist: I feel most comfortable programming in Python and R. I've also worked with Linux Bash, Nextflow, C++, C# (in Unity) and SQL in the past.

- :bulb: My interests lie in Software Development, Data Science, Machine Learning and AI, in addition to Molecular Biology.
  
- ðŸ¤“ I have a passion for programming, reading, and creative and academic writing.
  
- :heart_on_fire: I love problem solving, critical thinking, organizing and am always focused on improving myself. Most of all, I just want to gain experience and learn.
