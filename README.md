### Hi, I'm Amarise 😄

I'm a MSc Bioinformatics & Systems Biology student with a Bachelor's in Computer Science (Bioinformatics track).

- :dna: Recently finished my internship, where I focused on developing a pipeline in Nextflow to analyze a variant of RNA-seq data.

- :technologist: I feel most comfortable programming in Python and R, and am presently gaining experience in Nextflow and Linux bash. I've also worked with C++, C# (in Unity) and SQL in the past.

- :bulb: My interests lie in Software Development, Data Science, Machine Learning and AI, in addition to  Molecular Biology.
  
- 🤓 I have a passion for programming, reading, and creative and academic writing.
  
- :heart_on_fire: I love problem solving, critical thinking, organizing and am always focused on improving myself.
